# Input Overview

Acts as an initial note taking point where I can quickly jot down notes/ideas
during development, but I don't know where exactly this information should belong.
All notes here are subject to relocation or deletion later.

## ID vs Class

- Classes: Everything
- IDs: ONLY when I need to interact with an element using JS
